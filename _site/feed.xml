        <title>Tears We Cannot Stop - reading list</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Collection of books recommended by Michael Eric Dyson in his book, “Tears We Cannot Stop: A Sermon to White America”. Here’s a New York Times &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/12/books/review/tears-we-cannot-stop-michael-eric-dyson.html&quot;&gt;book review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Sending emails with Node.js, Gmail, and IFTTT</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently had to set up an email confirmation system for the Atlas of Design in preparation for the next call for participation. The submissions platform is written in Node.js using Express and uses AWS for the data storage and map uploads. The last bit of the puzzle was just a simple email to send folks after they submitted their map. This proved a bit harder than anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Perspectives in the apocalypse</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An ongoing series of perspectives in an undefined apocalypse. This is my attempt to write regularly without worrying about the consequences.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Making things out of wood</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I’ve been exploring wood working in my spare time. Not the kind where I find the nicest cut of Old Oak or make the perfect lap joint, more the kind where I try to make 2x4’s look good, which has been a remarkably enjoyable challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Creating an RSS JSON API - a Google Feed API alternative</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Last month (December 2016) the Google Feed API was discontinued. The CUGOS website (cugos.org) used the Google Feed API to list out the recent posts in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/forum/#!aboutgroup/cugos&quot;&gt;Google Group&lt;/a&gt;, which has a less-than-stellar user interface. The JavaScript console on cugos.org looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Object.assign()</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I came across the JavaScript &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/assign&quot;&gt;Object.assign()&lt;/a&gt; method recently, which is used to copy properties from one or more objects into a new or target object. Here’s how it’s used:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Making a book - The Atlas of Design</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been an assitant editor and editor for the Atlas of Design for nearly 4 years. I was extremely lucky to have piggy-backed on the work of Daniel Huffman and Tim Wallace for Volume 1. The foundation they laid set a bar higher than most expected. They gathered the interest, had a budget approved, and sold 1600 books over the course of two years.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Developing with NPM &amp; GitHub branches</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Much of my recent work at Mapbox has been around developing and testing node modules lay the groundwork of our vector tile pipeline. All of our node modules that we use across tools, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/tilelive&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;tilelive&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, are published to NPM, which means we release semantically versioned updates.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>First month at Mapbox</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year I began working at &lt;a href=&quot;https://mapbox.com&quot;&gt;Mapbox&lt;/a&gt;! My first month on the job has revolved around ensuring geographic data is reliably created, stored, and shared. A ton of Mapbox’s tools and products rely on &lt;a href=&quot;http://mapnik.org/&quot;&gt;Mapnik&lt;/a&gt;, which refers to itself as &lt;em&gt;an open source toolkit for developing mapping applications&lt;/em&gt;. Mapnik does &lt;strong&gt;a lot&lt;/strong&gt;, but lately we’ve been pushing really hard on ensuring all of the vector tiles it produces are compliant with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mapbox/vector-tile-spec&quot;&gt;Mapbox Vector Tile Specification&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Geocoding in the terminal with Mapbox</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;In need of geocoding a number of addresses in a CSV file for some mapping work, I created a module &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;mbgeocode&lt;/code&gt; that ingests a CSV and outputs a GeoJSON file of all successfull addresses geocoded. This project relies on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mapbox.com/developers/api/geocoding/&quot;&gt;Mapbox geocoding API&lt;/a&gt;, which allows for requests sent via &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;HTTPS&lt;/code&gt; and returns geocoded information in the form of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mapbox/carmen/blob/master/carmen-geojson.md&quot;&gt;Carmen GeoJSON&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>These aren't the maps you're looking for.</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week I attended my first &lt;a href=&quot;http://stateofthemap.us/&quot;&gt;State of the Map US&lt;/a&gt; (SOTM), an annual conference for those within or interested in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.openstreetmap.org/&quot;&gt;OpenStreetMap&lt;/a&gt; (OSM). The conference was held in New York City at the UN headquarters, which was a most excellent venue. Not having been to an OSM-specific conference before, I was interested to see how it stacked up to the other, more general mapping conferences such as FOSS4G. I expected something smaller and more focused, relating purely to OSM and it’s triumphs and failures thus far.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Concerning users: your neighbor's birthday was last week.</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the past month I’ve been &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/codeforamerica/rva-screening&quot;&gt;working on an application&lt;/a&gt; at Code for America and the city of Richmond, VA that aims to allow health clinics to share patient eligibility information with other health-related services (&lt;a href=&quot;http://rva.codeforamerica.org/april&quot;&gt;more about the screening process&lt;/a&gt;). Put simply, the goal is to remove redundancy in the referral process for patients and screeners.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Known.</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;A crashing ocean appears in front of me. Treacherously beautiful and unsettlingly inviting. Behind me lies a forest enveloped in a warm evening sun. The comfort of &lt;em&gt;the known&lt;/em&gt;. Predictability and assurance of peace and rest. Looking forward presents the very absence of rest and an uncontrollable disobedience of the unknown.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Code for Burritos. And America.</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;The new year has come with myriad changes. Having moved to the Bay Area recently for my year-long fellowship with Code for America I’ve found myself in a very new place professionaly and mentally. The one thing that has me incredibly jazzed about this year, though, is the community of people around me that have taken the plunge into civic technology.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>D3 Background Hash Patterns</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;D3 is one of my favorite mapping tools, largely because it makes me still feel like a cartographer in a land where markers and map tiles reign supreme (though you can find beautiful cartography in map tiles as well!). It reminds me of creating static maps in Illustrator and having control over the exact styles visible to the viewer. One important style to work with in any cartographic product is the concept of styling &lt;strong&gt;no data&lt;/strong&gt; - or, the absense of data from the map, which can be just as important as the data itself (&lt;em&gt;or themselves&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Animating Page Scroll with Anchor Hash</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;When using in-page anchor links, you typically create the &lt;span&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; tag with the &lt;span&gt;id&lt;/span&gt; hash of the element you want to scroll to - &lt;span&gt;&amp;lt;a href=”#your-element”&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;. The default functionality is to jump the page to that anchor point instantly, without any animation. This can be somewhat confusing for a user, especially if you want your site to be notably vertical and in a specific order.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Responsive YouTube Embeds</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;The responsive nature of the modern web is making content integration tricky - especially in the age of video. Working with Youtube videos typically involves &lt;span&gt;&amp;lt;iframe&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; embeds, which don’t give you a ton of freedom due to Cross Origin Issues unless you use the Youtube API. The API can be a bit cumbersome for a simple, single video though.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Retrieve site URL via JS</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Working with multi-sites can be tricky, especially when you have specific scripts running that require specific information based on the differing site domains. I typically run into this issue when I need to grab, for instance, an instagram feed for a specific restaurant, but another feed for another restaurant and both are using the same javascript file. The following script can be used for any number of reasons, but my favorites are:&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;Here’s a teeny, awesome little design touch I’ve been into lately. It fakes out a border with the CSS &lt;span&gt;box-shadow&lt;/span&gt; class but removes the spread and uses &lt;span&gt;rgba()&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Creating GeoJSON in client-side JS</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Often times I find myself with spatial data in non-spatial formats. Equally as often, those data cannot be permanently changed into a spatial format since they are being continually updated in their original format by someone else. Rendering spatial data requires GeoJSON. GeoJSON is derived from JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) and adds a spatial key/value pair into the mix. The data type has a required format, which can be found at &lt;a href=&quot;http://geojson.org&quot;&gt;geojson.org&lt;/a&gt; and seen below:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Cartography: Path or Profession?</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently had a conversation with Sam Pepple (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/DrSvalbard&quot;&gt;@drsvalbard&lt;/a&gt;) about cartography and its place as a profession and a practice. It was a quick and spontaneous chat but it made me think about cartography as a study. When I began cartography courses in school, I assumed I was learning how to become a cartographer. How to make maps and take that skill into the professional world as a map maker.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Collaborative Cartographic Age</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently attended the annual conference for the North American Cartographic Information Society (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nacis.org/&quot;&gt;NACIS&lt;/a&gt;) down in Portland, Oregon. NACIS is a geographic community focused on the creation of maps, their beauty, and their influence on the greater informed world. The three days of meetings and discussion led to some high-quality, genuine connections that humbled my existence as a cartographer and curator of digital information.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Cartographer's Dilema</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I was in an interview yesterday where I found myself answering questions about my resume. I’ve never had someone examine it so closely yet ask so many substantial questions. It was a good thing I knew what was on there and wasn’t lying about what I’ve done, otherwise I would have looked-a-cheat. The interviewer pointed out one thing that has stuck with me since: “Your objective on your resume is quite vague” - I quickly thought to myself about how absolutely correct he was, and how much that didn’t make sense considering people point out basically exactly what they want in a career in their “Objective” section. That’s why it’s an objective.&lt;/p&gt;
