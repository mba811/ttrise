I"»<p>I recently had a conversation with Sam Pepple (<a href="https://twitter.com/DrSvalbard">@drsvalbard</a>) about cartography and its place as a profession and a practice. It was a quick and spontaneous chat but it made me think about cartography as a study. When I began cartography courses in school, I assumed I was learning how to become a cartographer. How to make maps and take that skill into the professional world as a map maker.</p>
