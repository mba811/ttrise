I"¤<p>I was in an interview yesterday where I found myself answering questions about my resume. Iâ€™ve never had someone examine it so closely yet ask so many substantial questions. It was a good thing I knew what was on there and wasnâ€™t lying about what Iâ€™ve done, otherwise I would have looked-a-cheat. The interviewer pointed out one thing that has stuck with me since: â€œYour objective on your resume is quite vagueâ€ - I quickly thought to myself about how absolutely correct he was, and how much that didnâ€™t make sense considering people point out basically exactly what they want in a career in their â€œObjectiveâ€ section. Thatâ€™s why itâ€™s an objective.</p>
