I"n<p>Earlier this year I began working at <a href="https://mapbox.com">Mapbox</a>! My first month on the job has revolved around ensuring geographic data is reliably created, stored, and shared. A ton of Mapbox’s tools and products rely on <a href="http://mapnik.org/">Mapnik</a>, which refers to itself as <em>an open source toolkit for developing mapping applications</em>. Mapnik does <strong>a lot</strong>, but lately we’ve been pushing really hard on ensuring all of the vector tiles it produces are compliant with the <a href="https://github.com/mapbox/vector-tile-spec">Mapbox Vector Tile Specification</a>.</p>
