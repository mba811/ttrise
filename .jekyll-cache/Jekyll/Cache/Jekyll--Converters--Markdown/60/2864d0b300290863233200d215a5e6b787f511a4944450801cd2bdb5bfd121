<p>When trying to describe a system or technical workflow, I find it easier to sketch the flow of information rather than describe in paragraph form. I create drawings like the one below:</p>

<p><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8085/28427721504_ce9be71c7a.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><em>The following workflow is largely influenced from my former teammate <a href="http://benjamingolder.com/">Ben Golder</a> at Code for America.</em></p>

<h2 id="sketch-out-the-idea">Sketch out the idea</h2>

<p><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8456/28972501671_e2a75030d5_z.jpg" alt="sketch" /></p>

<h2 id="trace-sketch-with-pen">Trace sketch with pen</h2>

<p>This increases contrast between the paper and the drawing, which is useful in the next step. Also erase the pencil marks once youâ€™ve traced it out in pen.</p>

<h2 id="adobe-capture-cc-previously-adobe-shape-cc">Adobe Capture CC (previously Adobe Shape CC)</h2>

  <li>Take the photo and adjust the bar to pick up more or less detail.</li>
  <li>Clean up any captured fragments with the cleaning tool</li>
  <li>Convert it to a vector</li>
  <li>Now itâ€™s in your Adobe CC library!</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="clean-in-adobe-illustrator">Clean in Adobe Illustrator</h2>

<p>Import it into Illustrator using your CC library.</p>

<p><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8523/29048601835_6bce254d26_z.jpg" alt="import" /></p>

<p>And drag it into your artboard - now you have a vector-version of the drawing.</p>

<h2 id="add-color-with-illustratorphotoshop">Add color with Illustrator/Photoshop</h2>

<p>If I want to retain the <em>sketch</em> aspect of the drawing, I move into Photoshop and use the different brush tools. Otherwise you can add color in Illustrator.</p>
