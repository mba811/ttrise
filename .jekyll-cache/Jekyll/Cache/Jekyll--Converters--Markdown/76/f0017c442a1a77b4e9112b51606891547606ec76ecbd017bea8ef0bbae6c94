I"Ò<p>Recently Iâ€™ve been exploring wood working in my spare time. Not the kind where I find the nicest cut of Old Oak or make the perfect lap joint, more the kind where I try to make 2x4â€™s look good, which has been a remarkably enjoyable challenge.</p>

<h2 id="the-tools">The tools</h2>

<p>First of all, I have very few tools. Iâ€™m a renter and space is limited, plus I have that constant voice in the back of my head telling me Iâ€™m going to regret buying things because Iâ€™ll have to move them eventually. Thankfully, there is an extensive tool library community in Seattle. Iâ€™ve been renting from the <a href="https://www.phinneycenter.org/tools/">Phinney Ridge tool lending library</a> and couldnâ€™t recommend it more.</p>

<p>My toolkit consists of whatever miter or circular saw we can get our hands on, a power drill, hand sander, long metal clamps, and a random assortment of jigs, bits, and hardware. Pretty simple, but Iâ€™m approaching the tools on a as-needed basis in order to best learn about the reasons <em>why</em> Iâ€™d use such a tool.</p>

<p>The most recent addition has been a <a href="https://www.kregtool.com/store/c13/kreg-jigsreg/p169/kreg-jigreg-r3/">Kreg pocket hole jig</a> and clamp, which has been pretty revolutionary. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pocket-hole_joinery">Pocket holes</a> have provided impressive strength for joins that would otherwise be pretty flimsy. Without special routers to making nice hardware-free joins, the Kreg jig has made life super easy.</p>

<p>This took two weekends. Cutting and assembly in the first weekend, sanding and staining during the second. The hardest part here was cutting the lap joints (where the Xâ€™s intersect) which we did by hand with a hand saw and chisel. Using a table saw to get these cut perfectly would be an excellent choice. Itâ€™s not perfect (obvious by the misaligned top pieces in the photos below) but does exactly what we need it to.</p>

<p>This took one weekend. Basically a combination of 2x6â€™s on the top, 4x4â€™s for the legs, 2x4â€™s for the horizontal supports, and 1x10â€™s for the bottom shelf. Used an â€œold mahoganyâ€ stain, which is basically cheating our way out of purchasing nice wood. We also spray painted some 90 degree fasteners and added them to the corners for a little flair.</p>
