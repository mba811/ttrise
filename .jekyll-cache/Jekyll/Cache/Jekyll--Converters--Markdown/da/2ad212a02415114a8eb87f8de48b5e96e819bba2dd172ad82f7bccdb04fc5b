I":<p>D3 is one of my favorite mapping tools, largely because it makes me still feel like a cartographer in a land where markers and map tiles reign supreme (though you can find beautiful cartography in map tiles as well!). It reminds me of creating static maps in Illustrator and having control over the exact styles visible to the viewer. One important style to work with in any cartographic product is the concept of styling <strong>no data</strong> - or, the absense of data from the map, which can be just as important as the data itself (<em>or themselves</em>).</p>
