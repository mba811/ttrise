I"£<p>I stumbled upon <a href="http://www.vox.com/a/internet-maps">an article</a> the other day that caught my eye. In particular - the usage of a CSS technique I had never seen beforeâ€¦ <span>::first-letter</span>.</p>

<p>Who knew!? I surely did not.</p>

<div class="first">
To the east the outflung arm of the mountains marched to a sudden end, and far lands could be
descried beyond them, wide and vague. To the south the Misty Mountains receded endlessly as far
as sight could reach. Less than a mile away, and a little below them, for they still stood high up on the west side of the dale, there lay a mere. It was long and oval, shaped like a great spear-head thrust deep into the northern glen; but its southern end was beyond the shadows under the sunlit sky. Yet its waters were dark: a deep blue like clear evening sky seen from a lamp-lit room. Its face was still and unruffled. About it lay a smooth sward, shelving down on all sides to its bare unbroken rim.

<p>The pseudo selector is relatively straightforward, though you can find yourself in a world of hurt if you start trying to select the first paragraph element in a container. Itâ€™s best to try and pinpoint your first paragraph by a unique classname.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-css" data-lang="css"><span class="nt">p</span><span class="nd">::first-letter</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nl">font-size</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="m">5em</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="nl">color</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="no">steelblue</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="nl">line-height</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="m">1</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="nl">font-weight</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="m">900</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="nl">margin</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="m">0</span> <span class="m">.1em</span> <span class="m">-.3em</span> <span class="m">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="nl">float</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="nb">left</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Below is how to select the first paragraph tag in a container and act on the first letter:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-css" data-lang="css"><span class="nt">p</span><span class="nd">:first-child::first-letter</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="c">/* stuffs */</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Youâ€™re safe using the double colon <span>::</span> as the selector if you are working in modern browsers. But the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::first-letter">Mozilla docs</a> say if you need IE8 or earlier support, use the single colon.</p>
