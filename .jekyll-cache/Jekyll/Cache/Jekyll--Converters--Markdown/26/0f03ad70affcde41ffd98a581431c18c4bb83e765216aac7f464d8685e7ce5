I"Õ<p>Over the past month Iâ€™ve been <a href="https://github.com/codeforamerica/rva-screening">working on an application</a> at Code for America and the city of Richmond, VA that aims to allow health clinics to share patient eligibility information with other health-related services (<a href="http://rva.codeforamerica.org/april">more about the screening process</a>). Put simply, the goal is to remove redundancy in the referral process for patients and screeners.</p>
