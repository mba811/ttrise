I"Ù<p>I recently attended the annual conference for the North American Cartographic Information Society (<a href="http://www.nacis.org/">NACIS</a>) down in Portland, Oregon. NACIS is a geographic community focused on the creation of maps, their beauty, and their influence on the greater informed world. The three days of meetings and discussion led to some high-quality, genuine connections that humbled my existence as a cartographer and curator of digital information.</p>
