I"„<p>I‚Äôve been an assitant editor and editor for the Atlas of Design for nearly 4 years. I was extremely lucky to have piggy-backed on the work of Daniel Huffman and Tim Wallace for Volume 1. The foundation they laid set a bar higher than most expected. They gathered the interest, had a budget approved, and sold 1600 books over the course of two years.</p>

<p>I was asked to be an editor with Daniel for Volume 2 a year later after Tim stepped down. This time, in it‚Äôs most basic form, is when I realized being ‚Äúdetail oriented‚Äù was not a line I could confidently add to my resum√©. Daniel pours his heart and soul into his work, the <em>Atlas</em> just a single node in what is an extraordinary portfolio. With Volume 2, he converted the Atlas from a single project into a respected series showcasing excellent cartography around the world. As is now custom for the <em>Atlas</em>, each editor serves a two-volume term. Daniel stepped down last year to take on a more Administrative role with NACIS and Marty Elmer stepped in.</p>

<p>Editing the Atlas of Design has been one of my biggest challenges.</p>

<p>Typically when I‚Äôm considering a project ‚Äúfinal‚Äù that doesn‚Äôt mean I can‚Äôt change it later. A website can be fixed within minutes of realizing an error. Typos can be subdued, images can be re-optimized, even opinions can be revoked. But when it comes to sending a giant envelope of proofs for a book to be printed nearly 1000 times over, that‚Äôs finite. Any little blip, forgotten umlaut, incorrectly converted CMYK image, or missing period lives <strong>forever</strong>.</p>

<p>Designing the <em>Atlas</em> isn‚Äôt all about tweaking margins in InDesign and looking at pretty maps, though. The Editors handle communications &amp; social media, designing &amp; maintaining the website, creating a submission platform, creating a judging platform, communicating with individual contributors about their maps and commentary, writing release forms to get the rights to print the maps, coordinating with the printer about materials &amp; reviewing proofs, writing budget requests for NACIS, handling warehousing &amp; fulfillment (until recently for every single book, manually), and generally hoping that the ground doesn‚Äôt crumble beneath our feet.</p>

<p>When working on the <em>Atlas</em>, I swing back and forth between editing order details in spreadsheets to sending tweets to encrypting AWS credentials to properly talk to DynamoDB for the judging platform. Making a book isn‚Äôt just about printing the pages, it‚Äôs about conducting and distilling an impressive amount of information into what happens to be a 98 page book. Each contributor‚Äôs map means a whole lot to them, and we have to give our whole selves to each and every one.</p>

<p>Volume 3 went on sale last month with 900 copies in the first run. The third volume has been picked up by National Geographic, WIRED, and a few other journals &amp; blogs. The response has been fantastic. In the coming months I have a large task of documenting the 4+ years of decisions we‚Äôve made in order to build a knowledge base for future editors.
