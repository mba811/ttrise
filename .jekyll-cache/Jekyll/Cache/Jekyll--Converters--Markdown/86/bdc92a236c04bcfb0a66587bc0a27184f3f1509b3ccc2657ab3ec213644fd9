I"S<p>Last week I attended my first <a href="http://stateofthemap.us/">State of the Map US</a> (SOTM), an annual conference for those within or interested in <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> (OSM). The conference was held in New York City at the UN headquarters, which was a most excellent venue. Not having been to an OSM-specific conference before, I was interested to see how it stacked up to the other, more general mapping conferences such as FOSS4G. I expected something smaller and more focused, relating purely to OSM and itâ€™s triumphs and failures thus far.</p>
